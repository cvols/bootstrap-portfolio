                            My name is Chris Volonnino, born and raised in New Jersey.  Grew up locally playing ice hockey and was lucky enough to play across North America, including Wisconsin, Nebraska, and British Columbia, Canada.  I then went to the University of Delaware where I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from the Alfred E Learner College of Business and Economics.

I've deployed one web site with one of my friends who's father works for a non profit in Edison NJ.  I developed the entire front end from scratch, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Angular 2.

                                    I've been working in the IT industry for the past two and a half years with a Fortune 10 company here in NJ, meeting with stakeholders discussing their key projects and initiatives.  I'm  comfortable speaking with Vice Presidents, Directors, Managers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, Architects, Developers, QA Engineers, Designers, and everyone involved in the full SDLC.

                                    I come from a very athletic and competitive background.  I don't know if I love winning or hate losing more.  I'm the type of person that when I set my mind to something I have to be the best at it.  In 2016, I was the Account Manager of the year for Apex in NJ.  Now I'm tackling a new challenge in 2017 and going into 2018: web and application development.  I'm an extremely hard worker and don't mind working early, late, and/or long hours.  I just want to make sure I'm not only the hardest worker in the room, but I'm the best.  If I'm not the best, then I'm doing whatever I can to compete and learn more to eventually be the best.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I <b>want</b> to do this and I'm completely <b>green!</b>  I absolutely love learning new technologies and different ways to do things.  I'm taking classes after hours and on the weekends to learn on my own.  I spend my free time coding and helping friends and family with websites they want me to create.  The best part is I want to learn your systems and applications and be a part of a team that is creating awesome websites and applications!
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        <p class="pads">
                            Why coding?  I love problem solving and the ability to be creative.  Coding gives me the opportunity to work with team members and constantly involve by changing and learning.  I love the ability to constantly grow and will do whatever it takes to be a proven asset to your team.
